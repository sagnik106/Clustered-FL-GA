# Clustered FL GA

The work exlpores the application of **Genetic Algorithm** and **DBSCAN clustering** for efficient training and communication in **Federated Learning**.  
 
 
### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them
```
matplotlib
numpy 
random
sklearn
itertools
tensorflow==2.2
```

## Getting Started

Download a python interpeter preferable a version beyond 3.0 and jupyter notebook to support the same. Install the prerequisute libraries given above,and make sure you have the correct version of **TensorFlow**. Also certain hardware and software requirements like good **Nvidia GPU** and **(CUDA+CUDNN)** respectively are required. Run the respective files for federated learning for MNIST dataset and CIFAR10 datset.

```
$ tf_cluster_cifar10.ipynb

$ tf_cluster_mnist.ipynb

```

## Cloning
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/sagnik106/Clustered-FL-GA
```
